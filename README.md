[^1]: ✅ using Steam Proton

## Installation
1. Make sure you are on the latest version of Polytopia.
2. Go to https://polymod.dev/. Click 'download' and accept the suspicious download.
3. Find the 'Steam' folder in your program files. Open up the 'steamapps' folder, content folder. Go to the 'common'  folder in the steamapps and look for Polytopia. We highly recommend backing up and saving “The Battle of Polytopia” folder in a separate place, just in order if you want to return playing regular game.
4. In the PolyMod Installer, browse and search for Polytopia, the in Steamapps folder. Hit “launch." It will take a few moments to load.
5. Go to the ⁠mods forum on our discord and download the mods you want to install.
6. Put those mod files in the 'Mods' folder in the 'Battle of Polytopia' folder.
7. Start up the game. Play. Enjoy.
