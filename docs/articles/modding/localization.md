# Localization
Localization is a json file in a mod that declares mod's localization strings. Mod localization is declared in `localization.json` file.

If you've ever used the custom language system before it was removed, you'll notice that the keys follow the same format as custom langs, but **with all the periods replaced with underscores**.
If you want to translate your strings to other languages, you can simply use a comma and enter another language's name with its corresponding string.
