# Game Data Reference

Welcome to the game data reference documentation. This section provides a detailed breakdown of the structure of the main JSON data file. Use this reference to understand how to modify existing game elements or create your own custom content, such as new tribes, units, or technologies.

Each page documents the schema for a top-level section of the JSON file (e.g., `tribeData`, `unitData`). It explains the purpose of each property and the types of values it expects.
